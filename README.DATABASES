Database support for SNIPS has NOT been completed.

The following files were the beginning of an attempt to add database
support to SNIPS. The API's being developed were for ODBC (using libiodbc)
and Oracle (using the OCI C interface).

	README.MYSQL
	README.ORACLE

	lib/odbc_api.c
	lib/oracle_api.c

This has NOT been tested or integrated into the SNIPS code.
