README for SNIPS v1.0 (a.k.a  NOCOL v5.0)
=====================

SNIPS (Systems & Network Integrated Polling Software) is a rewrite
of the popular NOCOL network monitoring package with many additional
features and bug fixes, most notably integration with RRDtool for
graphing and historical trends.

It runs on Unix platforms and is capable of monitoring network and
system variables such as ICMP or RPC reachability, SNMP variables,
nameservers, tcp ports, ethernet load, host performance, SNMP traps,
modem line usage, appletalk & novell routes/services, BGP peers, syslog
files, etc.

The available user interfaces (displays) are:

    - Web based (websnips)
    - Tcl/Tk based (tkSnips)
    - Text/curses based (textsnips)

Any number of displays can run and they all view common monitored data from a 
single set of monitoring agents.

The monitored data is also stored using RRD, and can be plotted using MRTG
style graphs. Devices are escalated in severity during successive monitoring
cycles to avoid generating excessive operator level alarms and customizable
priority notification.

This package is being used to monitor networks with as many as 1600 devices
in many ISPs.

To date, the various monitoring agents developed are:

	- ICMP
	- RPC portmapper
	- Ethernet load (bandwidth & pps)
	- TCP ports
	- Radius servers
	- SYSLOG logfiles (for specified patterns)
	- BGP peer status
	- SQL (using DBI interface)
	- Unix host performance (disks, memory, swap, load, nfs, collisions)
	- SNMP variables monitor (RMON, Cisco router, terminal server)
	- TCP data throughput monitor
	- Nameserver (named)
	- SNMP traps
	- NTP stratum (Network Time Protocol)
	- UPS (APC) battery level monitor
	- Usage of terminal server modem lines (busy lines)
	- Appletalk route monitor (for cisco routers)
	- Novell service monitor
	
A PERL interface is available for developing additional monitors in the PERL
programming language (it is fairly easy to add additional monitors to the
package).

The logging daemon can be interfaced with a paging program such as
'sendpage' (or other SMS devices) to send device failure notifications.

The software is freely available on the Internet from:

	ftp://ftp.navya.com/pub/snips.tar.gz 

Please send a message to 'snips-users-request@navya.com' to be added to the
'snips-users' mailing list for updates and bug fixes. Mail comments and
bugs to 'vikas@navya.com'.
