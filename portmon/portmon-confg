# Config file for portmon snips monitor
#
# Can monitor TCP ports such as:  www, smtp, pop, news, gopher
#
# Order is important... the first substring match (case ignored) will return
# and NOT test the remaining strings. Put the high severity tests first.
# To check just connectivity to a port, just put the HOST line.
#
# Format:
#	POLLINTERVAL  600
#	TIMEOUT 30
#	SIMULCONNECTS 64
#	HOST <name> <addr>  <variable>  <port#> <failseverity> [send-string]
#	[maxseverity	response]
#	[maxseverity	response]
#	QUIT  string to close connection
#
# 'send-string'  and the responses are optional. \r\n in 'send-string' are 
# converted to CR and LF respectively. A 'newline' is sent after each
# string. Remember that connections to http daemons needs two newlines.
