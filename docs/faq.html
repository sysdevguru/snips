<h3>GENERAL</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><a name="gen0">What is SNIPS ?</a></b></dt>
  <dd><font color="#AA0000">SNIPS</font> (System and Network Integrated Polling
    Software) is a complete package for monitoring networks or Unix systems. It
    can generate alarms based on thresholds, graph monitored data using RRDtool
    (MRTG style) and generally offer all the functions that you would expect
    from a monitoring package. It is being used in large ISP networks to monitor
    as many as 1500+ devices. The most popular SNIPS monitors are&nbsp;&nbsp;
    for TCP ports, ICMP (ippingmon), RPC (rpcpingmon), Unix systems (hostmon),
    SNMP variables (snmpmon).</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="gen1"><b>How does SNIPS differ from NOCOL?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>SNIPS is a complete rewrite of NOCOL (which was released in 1991 as
    freeware also) and supports many enhanced features not available earlier (RRDtool
    graphing support, more customizable monitors). The core has been rewritten
    entirely and is better suited to future extensibility. It supports all the
    monitors that were available in NOCOL, but uses a slightly different&nbsp;
    and enhanced event data structure. These enhancements were necessary to
    permit future enhancements in the product.
    <p>If you are a current user of Nocol, SNIPS is a drop in replacement. You
    can install SNIPS and then copy over all your existing NOCOL configuration
    files without modifications. However, SNIPS allows additional keywords in
    some monitors (rrd support, ippingmon more flexible, etc.) so you should see
    if you want to add these keywords to your configuration files. Change your
    mail aliases and /etc/services file to replace 'noclog' with 'snipslog'&nbsp;
    and 'nocol' with 'snips' and you should be done.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b><a name="gen2">How does SNIPS differ from MRTG ?</a></b></dt>
  <dd>SNISP&nbsp; is a <em>complete monitoring</em> package which detects
    outages or errors on your devices and generate alarms/pages when this
    happens. In addition, it also generates stores historical data in the MRTG 'rrdtool'
    format, and can generate graphs similar to MRTG.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="gen3"><b>What is Fidelia's <i>Assurance</i>?</b></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Assurance</i> is a high performance, massively scalable performance
    monitoring solution from <a href="http://www.fidelia.com">Fidelia, Inc.</a>
    They granted time and support to the author for releasing SNIPS in the
    public domain even while working at Fidelia on the development of their next
    generation product (which supports distributed databases, collection and
    storage, entirely web based NMS system, multi-tiered user security, etc.)</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="gen4"><b>Where do I get SNIPS</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The distribution site is at <a href="http://www.netplex-tech.com/software/snips/downloads">http://www.netplex-tech.com</a>.
    It can also be downloaded via ftp from <a href="ftp://ftp.navya.com/pub/">ftp.navya.com</a></dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="gen5"><b>What about support ?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>SNIPS is freeware, and hence no official support is available. However, it
    is a popular product and you can send messages to the <b>snips-users@navya.com</b>
    mailing list or search the Web using any popular Internet search engine (Altavista,
    Excite) for your queries.<br>
    You can also email queries to <a href="mailto:dev@navya.com">snips-support@navya.com</a>
    which might grow larger in some distant future.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="gen6"><b>Is snips Y2K compliant ?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Yes. All events are logged to <i>snipslogd</i> in the Unix timestamp
    format, so the timestamps are not effected by the Y2K problem.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
</dl>
<hr width="75%" noshade>
<h3>INSTALLATION</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="R0"><b>What are the hardware requirements ?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Snips can run very comfortably on any Pentium-100 class Unix machine with
    64MB of RAM and monitor several hundred devices. It is very lightweight in
    design and implementation.<br>
    <br>
    There are existing SNIPS users who are monitoring 1500+ devices using a
    Sparc Ultra-5.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="R1"><b>Should I run snips as root ?</b></a></dt>
  <dd><em>NO!</em> You should create a separate user such as 'snips'&nbsp; and
    all monitors should be run by this user. The few monitors which require root
    priveleges (such as pingmon or trapmon) are installed as suid root in the
    snips bin/ directory.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="R2"><b>I am getting lots of messages from <tt>keepalive_monitors</tt>
    about restarting</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Either your system's <tt>ps</tt> command is not listing the complete
    program name and <tt>keepalive_monitors</tt> is trying to restart the
    program since it thinks its down or else the monitor being restarted cannot
    write the pid or data file and is dying (incorrect owner and permissions on
    the <tt>snips/run</tt> directory).
    <p>If the monitor is not running, then try running it in debug mode (most
    monitors will take the <tt>-d</tt> option for running in debug mode). The
    errors from these programs are written to the&nbsp; <tt>run/</tt><em>prog</em><tt>.error</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="R3"><b>multiping gives error <i>socket: Operation not permitted</i></b></a></dt>
  <dd><b>multiping</b> requires a raw socket, and needs to be installed suid
    root. You probably did not run <tt>make root</tt> while installing snips.
    Check the ownership and permission of this program- it <em>must</em> show
    mode <tt>-rwsr-x--x</tt> with owner root. If not, do the following:
    <pre>		chown root multiping

		chmod 4751 multiping
	</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="R4"><b>Nothing is being logged to <i>snipslogd</i></b></a></dt>
  <dd>Events are logged ONLY when their state <em>changes</em>. Thus, an event
    will be logged to snipslogd if a device goes from info level to warning
    level, etc.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="R5"><b>Why do I get lots of sniplog messages when I restart a
    monitor?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When any monitor starts, it sets the state of all devices to
    'UNKNOWN'.&nbsp; After the first poll, it determines the actual state of the
    devices&nbsp; and logs it to snipslogd since its a change in the event's
    state. This information is important in snipslog since any intelligent log
    file parser should know when a monitor restarts.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="R6"><b>Why do I get "Warning: time of day goes back, taking
	      countermeasures" errors?</b></a></dt>
      <dd>This is coming from the system  <i>ping</i> used by 
	hostmon-collector. The bug report from Redhat
      is <a href="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37485">
      http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37485</a>.
	You can avoid this error message by setting the value of
	$ping in <i>snipsperl.conf</i> to multiping.

<h3>MISC</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="misc1"><b>Can snips handle SNMPv2 ?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>SNIPS uses the latest CMU SNMP library which does support SNMPv2.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="misc2"><b>How can I page myself when a device goes down?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Assuming that you have an alphanumeric pager and can page yourself using
    email or any other perl script, you can page yourself on a particular event
    by using snipslogd and piping the events to a simple script such as <tt>utility/beep_oncall</tt>.<br>
    In addition to <b>snipslogd</b>, you can also run <tt>utility/notifier.pl</tt>
    to page you.<br>
    Paging software such as <a href="http://www.qpage.org">qpage</a> can be used
    to do the actual paging.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="misc3"><b>How do I get notified when a device comes back up ?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>All monitors in snips log events to <tt>snipslogd</tt> based on the worst
    of new severity or previous severity of an event.
    <p>Hence, when a device goes down first, it will be logged at 'warning'
    level. If it comes back up, it will be marked as up but will be logged at a
    loglevel of 'warning' since that was the old severity. This mechanism allows
    you to not only detect when a device goes critical, but also detect when the
    device comes back up.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="misc4"><b>How do I get paged as soon as a device goes down ?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>In order to avoid false alarms (and prevent operators from getting into
    the habit of wait-and-it-will-go-away), SNIPS will escalate any events
    severity gradually. If you want to get paged or notified as soon as a device
    or variable changes, you can set alerts at the <i>Warning</i> level instead
    of the <i>Critical</i> level.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="misc5"><b>Can I setup host or variable dependencies in SNIPS?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The various displays do not handle dependencies at this time, but is on
    the wish list.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="misc6"><b>Where can I find an SSL web monitor?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This monitor is simple to write but requires linking against an SSL
    library which might be subject to US export regulations and hence is not
    available at this time.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="misc95"><b>Does snips run on windows NT ?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>SNIPS currently only runs on Unix platforms and there are currently no
    plans to port it to Windows platforms.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><a name="misc99"><b>Who maintains SNIPS ?</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This software is currently maintained by <a href="mailto:vikas@navya.com">Vikas
    Aggarwal</a> and is copyright Netplex Technologies, Inc.&nbsp; The SNMP
    library is Copyright Carnegie-Mellon University. Additionally, there are
    contributions by many users included as part of the core distribution, and
    this information is in the contributed files.</dd>
