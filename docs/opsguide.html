<h4>File Locations</h4>

<p>The main directory where snips gets installed is specified at compile time (default is
set to /usr/local/snips). The following sub-directories exist under this main directory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table class="small" border="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
    <tr>
      <td width="15%">bin/</td>
      <td>All monitors and utility scripts are in this directory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>data/</td>
      <td>The raw data collected by the monitors</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      displayed when a user clicks on the HELP button in snipsweb.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>A SysV style 'init' directory which contains scripts to start/stop/restart &nbsp; the
      various processes.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<h4>Configuration Files</h4>

<p>There is a global config file for all the C monitors <tt>snips.conf</tt>,
      typically stored under <tt>/etc</tt> or <tt>/usr/local/snips/etc</tt>
      (the software automatically searches for the file in any of these locations).
The snips loghost is read from this file, and this file also allows changing
other global directory settings. A common config file for all the <u>perl</u> monitors is located in the snips directory
under <tt>/usr/local/snips/etc/snipsperl.conf</tt>.</p>

<p>The configuration file for each individual monitor is located in the <tt>/usr/local/snips/etc/</tt>
. There are sample configuration files located in the <tt>etc/samples</tt> subdirectory.
Using these sample files as templates, you should create configuration files for each
monitor that you want to use. Note that in most monitors, the 'name' of the device is not
really used by the monitor but is basically an operator friendly name for the device.</p>

<p>It is recommended that these configuration files be stored using RCS (or some other
revision control system) to prevent multiple operators from editing a file at the same
time and also keeping old revisions automatically.</p>

<h4>Starting the Monitors</h4>

<p>There are two ways to start the monitors- you can start a particular monitor <u>manually</u>
using the corresponding <tt>init</tt> script in the <tt>init.d/</tt>&nbsp; directory or <u>automatically</u>
from crontab using the <b>keepalive_monitors.pl</b> script. This script is run
periodically from crontab and ensures that all the desired monitors are running.</p>

<p>You must list all desired monitors in the <b>keepalive_monitor.pl</b> script (edit the <tt>@{$snipshost}</tt>
variable). Ensure that you have setup email aliases for the operations staff and also
created a 'snips' user to run all these programs (all these steps are listed in the
Installation document). Any error messsages from the monitors are written to the <strong>run/xxxx.error</strong>&nbsp;
file. This file is mailed to the OPSMAIL email address when a monitor is restarted.</p>

<p>After you have created the config files and edited keepalive_monitors, ensure that the
contents of bin/crontab.snips are loaded into cron (typically done using&nbsp;&nbsp; cat
bin/crontab.snips | cron).</p>

<p>When changes are made to a config file, you can reload these changes by sending the
respective monitor a HUP signal (or using init.d/xxx.init&nbsp; hup). Alternatively, you
can also get the monitors to automatically reload their config files if they detect a
change by starting the monitors with the '-a' flag for auto-reload. You should ensure that
your changes are completely written out to the config file so that it is not half-edited
and unusable if you use this flag.</p>

<p>There might be a slight delay in reloading the config files on recieving a HUP signal,
since the monitor finishes its current polling cycle before reloading the file.</p>

<p>Generally the monitors do not need any command line argument- the default name and
location of the configuration file and the data directory is compiled into the monitors.
However, you can always specify an alternate config file or output data file using the
'-c' or the '-o' command line options respectively. All monitors also accept the '-d' flag
to indicate debug mode, in which case they write debug messages to the stderr. You can
send a USR1 signal to any monitor to increase the level of debugging (this increases with
each USR1 signal upto 2 and then resets to 0).</p>

<p>The keepalive_monitors.pl&nbsp; script starts the logging daemon (snipslogd) first so
that the monitors can log to this process (see next section for additional information on
snipslogd).</p>

<h4>snipslogd - the Logging Daemon</h4>

<p>The snipslogd daemon listens on port 5354 of the logging host for any events sent by
the monitors. The name of the host where snipslogd runs is set in the global <tt>snips.conf</tt>
&nbsp; config file.

<p>The snipslogd process is similar to the Unix 'syslog' daemon and the configuration file
allows piping the logged events to any external process. To prevent any random host from
sending it any messages, the list of allowed IP addresses (which can log to it) is listed
in the snipslogd configuration file.</p>

<p>Since this process can run external programs, it can be used to run the pager
notification scripts, etc. This program can be used to log messages to a database, send
emails, etc.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It should be noted that an 'event' in
snips is generated <em><strong>only</strong></em> when a value <u>crosses</u> a threshold
in any polling interval.</span> Hence, normally you will not see any logging activity in
snipslogd, but when a device variable <em>changes</em> its state, an event will be logged.
This means that an event will be sent by a monitor to snipslogd both when it goes down
(e.g. from info level to warning level) and also when it comes back up (e.g. warning level
to info level). The loglevel is the worse of the current level and previous level (hence,
when a device goes back from Critical to Info level, the event will be logged at loglevel
Critical).</p>

<h4>Messages Directory</h4>

<p>Each of the displays has a 'messages' section where the contents of the files in the
'MSGDIR' are displayed. You can create any text file in this directory (preferably one
line messages), and these are displayed in the 'Messages' subwindow.</p>

<h4>Routine Maintenance</h4>

<p>Routine admin tasks in SNIPS consist of ensuring that all the monitors are running
(done by running <em>keepalive_monitor.pl</em> from cron), &nbsp;and rotating all the log
files maintained by snipslogd (done by running <em>log-maint.pl </em>periodically from
crontab). The <em>log-maint.pl</em> script also runs the <strong>logstats.pl</strong>
reporting tool which mails the report to the OPSMAIL email address. See the file <font
size="2" face="Lucida Console,Courier">snips.crontab</font><font size="2"> where all these
maintenance tasks are listed.</font></p>

<hr noshade color="#808080">

<h3>2.&nbsp; <a name="userInterfaces">User Interfaces</a></h3>

<p>All the monitors store the current state of the devices in raw data format (in the
/usr/local/snips/data directory). There are three different user interfaces to view and
interpret this data. </p>

<p>Note that none of these interfaces displays historical data from 'snipslogd'- they all
work directly on the data being collected by the monitors which represents the current
state of the network.</p>

<h4>snipstv</h4>

<p><strong>snipstv</strong> (snips <u>T</u>ext<u>V</u>iew), is a non-graphical, text
'curses' based tool for displaying the raw data being collected by the monitors. Any user
on the system where the monitors are running can run this tool. Entering the 'e' key will
display different fields (since it is not possible to display all the possible fields in
the limited 80 character displays). It is possible to filter events, etc.- enter 'h' to
get detailed help on this tool.</p>

<h4>SnipsWeb</h4>

<p>The Web interface for displaying snips data is divided into three scripts- <strong>genweb.cgi</strong>
which reads all the data files and generates HTML with hyperlinks to <strong>snipsweb.cgi</strong>.
This script in turn invokes <strong>rrdgraph.cgi</strong> which generates RRD graphs for
the device. All these programs read the etc/snipsweb-cfg.pl&nbsp; configuration file on
startup, and this file should be edited to set your site settings.</p>

<p><tt>genweb.cgi</tt>&nbsp; can be run periodically from crontab to generate 4 web pages
(one for each severity level) or directly as a CGI program. When run as a CGI, it allows
sorting, filtering, etc. In CGI mode, the script is reading and generating HTML in
realtime, so if many users are accessing this CGI simultaneously, this could generate
additional load on your server. You should protect this script using standard htaccess
style authentication to restrict access to the script.</p>

<p><tt>snipsweb.cgi</tt>&nbsp; is the complement to genweb.cgi&nbsp; and&nbsp; gives added
functionality such as historical graphs, device specific help troubleshooting, adding
notes for an event, hiding a known event, etc. You should definitely protect this script
using the htaccess web authentication, even though this script has its own built in access
control also as an alternative. </p>

<p><tt>rrdgraph.cgi</tt>&nbsp; generates graphs for a device and all its monitored
variables. It is invoked by snipsweb.cgi, and restricts access by allowing only the CGI's
listed in the @OK_REFERER variable to run this script. This variable is customized in the
snipsweb-cfg.cgi file mentioned above.&nbsp; rrdgraph.cgi generates the images on the fly,
and caches the images on disk (in the <tt>rrdimg-cache/</tt> directory) also for
efficiency.</p>

<p>You should also create an <strong>etc/users</strong> file which lists the access level
of each user (which commands they are allowed to run in snipsweb.cgi). Additionally, you
can create help files in the <strong>device-help/</strong> directory which are named based
on the device and/or variable name. When a snipsweb user clicks on help for a device, the
program looks for a matching help file in the following order:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;devicename&gt;:&lt;deviceaddr&gt;
&lt;devicename&gt;:&lt;variable&gt;
&lt;devicename&gt;:&lt;sender&gt;
default</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where any of these can be the keyword 'default'.</p>

<p>All the CGI scripts print error messages on stderr, which get logged in the web
server's&nbsp; logfile when running in CGI mode. Look in these log files for errors in
case of trouble.</p>

<h4>tkSnips</h4>

<p>This is a Tcl/tk based monitor using client-server technology. A simple daemon (called
'ndaemon') runs on the SNIPS monitoring server listening on TCP port 5005 and it
periodically send the event raw data to all connected tksnips clients. The tksnips
client's then parse and format/display this snips raw data. ndaemon has no access control
at this time, so it is important to put a firewall to restrict unauthorized access to
ndaemon's TCP port.</p>

<hr noshade color="#808080">

<h3>3.&nbsp; <a name="notifications">Notifications &amp; Reports</a></h3>

<p>A very flexible notification script called&nbsp; '<strong>notifier.pl</strong>'&nbsp;
is provided with SNIPS which has a configuration file with the type of event and required
action. Currently the possible actions are&nbsp; <em>mail</em> and <em>page</em>. A
minimum and maximum age of the event can be defined indicating that the action should be
taken (paging or email) only if the age of the event lies between these two values (in
seconds). An option exists to allow 'repeat' notification (once every hour) until the age
is exceeded.</p>

<p>This program should be run from <em>crontab</em> every 5 minutes (set the value of
$crontime accordingly in the script if run at different time intervals). This program
should also be run from <em>snipslogd.conf</em>, so that it can send a notification as
soon as an event occurs. When run from crontab, this program only parses Critical events
and events that are down (i.e. no notification when they come up when run from crontab).
However, when run from snipslogd, it reads the log lines from the stdin, and sends
messages both when a device goes down and comes back up. The event time is set to a
negative -1 second when running as a filter from snipslogd, so the notifier-confg file
entry should be set accordingly.</p>

<p>It is possible to write additional 'event' driven notification systems using <em>snipslogd</em>.
Any event can be piped to an external script by snipslogd, so a page or email can be sent
as soon as an event occurs and is logged to snipslogd. As another example, the '<strong>utility/beep_oncall</strong>'
script uses the <em>sendpage</em> program (available from <a
href="ftp://ftp.net.ohio-state.edu/pub/pagers">ftp://ftp.net.ohio-state.edu/pub/pagers</a>).
Other (untested) alternatives to sendpage are are SNPP and YAPS.</p>

<p>Currently the only reporting tool for historical analysis is '<strong>logstats</strong>'
which parses the historical snipslogd event logs and generates a summary report. This is
run by the '<strong>log-maint</strong>' script which in turn is run periodically from Unix
cron.</p>

<hr noshade color="#808080">

<h3>4.&nbsp; <a name="largenets">Configurations for Large Networks</a></h3>

<p>Currently SNIPS is being used to monitor devices with close to 2000 devices. The
monitors which usually have large number of devices are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ippingmon - using ICMP echo messages (typically used for router interfaces)<br>
  portmon - for TCP sockets (typically used for web, mail, pop, imap ports)<br>
  hostmon - for Unix host performance (disk space, load, memory)<br>
  snmpmon - for querying SNMP data</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All these monitors except for snmpmon are designed for monitoring very large number of
devices in parallel very efficiently. As an example, ippingmon can monitor 500 devices in
a little over 2 minutes, and hostmon can poll 64 ports per minute. However, if the number
of devices is still larger, you can split your devices into multiple configuration files
&nbsp; and then use the '-x' flag to a monitor or create a symlink to the monitor to read
these alternate config files.</p>

<p>As an example, if you divide all your ippingmon devices between 2 config files, and
name these configuration files&nbsp; <tt>ippingmon-A-confg</tt>&nbsp; and <tt>ippingmon-B-confg</tt>.
All you have to do is either of the following methods:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>ln -s bin/ippingmon bin/ippingmon-A
ln -s bin/ippingmon bin/ippingmon-B</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>OR</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>ippingmon -x A
ippingmon -x B</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The monitor will automatically look for and load the respective config files based on
its own name (or '-x' extension) by appending '<tt>-confg</tt>' to it.</p>

<p>Remember to update the&nbsp; <em>keepalive_monitors</em> script with these new names or
flags if you use either of these methods.</p>

<h2><a name="appendix">APPENDIX</a></h2>

<h3>Monitors</h3>

<p>These are quick reference tables for the various field values in each of the current
SNIPS monitors. The 'address' field is typically used by the monitor to query the device.
The 'device name' field is usually a 'common' or 'alias' name for the device being
monitored. If there is a sub-device or sub-element (such as an interface, file partition
or domain name) being monitored, this is prefixed to the device name with a '+' as a
separator.</p>
