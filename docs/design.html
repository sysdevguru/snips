        <h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
        <p>SNIPS is a system and network monitoring software which runs on Unix
        platforms and monitors reachability, ports, routes, system resources,
        etc. It is modular in design, and allows adding new monitors easily and
        without impacting other portions of the software- in fact, a large
        number of the monitors are contributed by various SNIPS users.</p>
        <p>The basic design principles&nbsp; behind SNIPS are relatively few:
        <ul>
          <li>allow multiple users to see the same data being collected instead
            of requiring each user to start their own set of monitors</li>
          <li>multiple layers of severity to avoid any false alarms (to stop the
            NOC operator from ignoring an alarm because it 'usually goes away')</li>
          <li>optimized data storage- log a datapoint only when the severity of
            an event changes</li>
          <li>be able to view the events from a non-graphical interface</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The precursor to SNIPS (NOCOL) was developed in early 1990s when most
        of the commercial packages required pretty extensive hardware to run,
        whereas NOCOL could run on a very low end system, the monitors could be
        separated from the logging and reporting machine since they communicated
        over a network, and the datapoints collected were very small in number
        since they were only recorded when the severity of a device/variable
        changed. So, the disk space on a machine could vary from 10% to 60%
        full, and only one entry is logged since this would all be considered
        'normal'. If the disk becomes 80% full,&nbsp;&nbsp; a 'warning' message
        is generated and another datapoint is logged. This simple approach gives
        amazingly small volumes of data, and yet presents a perfectly
        comprehensive (though quantized) report on the variables.</p>
        <p>The graphing function in SNIPS is done using <a href="http://www.caida.org/tools">RRDtool</a>
        (same author as MRTG), which uses circular databases and aggregates
        historical data, thus preventing the databases from growing without
        bounds.</p>
        <p>The architecture of SNIPS itself is very simple- the monitors poll
        the devices and assign a threshold to each 'poll' (called an '<em>event</em>').
        These thresholds are user settable and vary from monitor to monitor (in
        fact, the core of the software does not care what is being monitored and
        does not store any intelligence about the variables). All intelligence
        of the variable being monitored and what conditions are to normal and
        abnormal is built into the monitor and their config files.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/snips-arch.gif" alt="snips-arch.gif" width="373" height="487"></p>
        <p>The monitor would then set:
        <ul>
          <li>the current value of the variable (thruput, lost packets)</li>
          <li>the current threshold (there can be upto 3 thresholds for 3
            different levels of severity)</li>
          <li>timestamp, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and invoke a Snips API function. This writes out the current values,
        etc. to a realtime data file on disk (this contains the current state of
        any device/variable) and if the severity has changed, then this also
        gets logged to a incremental logging daemon (snipslogd).</p>
        <p>All user displays can then display the data from the realtime data
        directory, whereas the alarm and notification subsystem gets activated
        by the incremental&nbsp; 'snipslogd' process. The snipslogd process can
        filter events based on user defined criteria, and invoke an SMS pager,
        send email, perhaps even run some automated tests or open a trouble
        ticket.</p>
        <p>An '<strong>event</strong>' is basically a unique tuple of&nbsp;
        device name + device address + variable name. Each event has the current
        data value of the variable being monitored, and also a threshold value
        corresponding to the current severity level. This is best understood by
        looking at the <em>event</em> data structure in the <em>snips.h</em> C
        include file.</p>
        <p>This simple architecture has proven to work very effectively in this
        application. The base system has not really changed since the software
        was initially written, but new monitors, displays, notification software
        is continually being added without any changes to the core system.</p>
        <hr noshade>
        <h2><a name="clibrary">The SNIPS C Library</a></h2>
        <p>The EVENT data structure for SNIPS has the following fields
        (presented in pseudocode here):</p>
        <blockquote>
          <small>
          <pre>#define DATA_VERSION 0x1</pre>
          <pre>char * sender		/* monitor name */
char * device.name
char * device.addr
char * var.name
u_long var.value
u_long var.threshold
char * var.units
u_char mon day hour min
u_char severity		/* enum CRITICAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO */
u_char loglevel		/* CRITICAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO */
u_char nocop		/* state of device- UP/DOWN etc. */
u_char rating		/* see below */
u_long op		/* for internal monitor use */
u_long id		/* unique event ID */</pre>
          </small>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The 'rating' field is a sequence of 0 and 1s and shows the status of
        the device for the last N polls (the most recent poll is on the left).
        The 'op' field is for future internal use by the monitors, and the 'id'
        is a unique event identifier which changes each time the state of the
        event changes (not implemented at this time).</p>
        <p>A typical C monitor has the following layout:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>snips_main()
	fork, create pid file, etc.
	read config file; ## monitor specific
	write data file with event state UNINIT;
	LOOP:
	foreach device {
		poll device;  ## monitor specific
		update event with UP/DOWN status
		write out event to datafile
	}
	repeat LOOP;</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The monitor needs to have 2 functions specific to the variable being
        monitored- <em>read_config()</em> and <em>poll_devices()</em>. It then
        sets the value of the global variables <tt>readconfig_func</tt> and <tt>polldevices_func</tt>
        to these two functions, and call <em>snips_main()</em>.&nbsp; That is
        all that is needed in most monitors.</p>
        <p>Deviations from the above process can be seen in the following
        monitors:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>trapmon</strong> - since it has to display incoming traps
          and not really 'poll' any device, this program expires old events
          after 30 minutes from the data file by zeroing them out.</p>
          <p><strong>etherload</strong> - it has a little more complicated
          initialization and monitoring since its very specific to the operating
          system.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <hr noshade>
        <h2><a name="monitors">The Monitors</a></h2>
        <p>The monitors collect variable values and compares to see if it
        exceeds any of the 3 thresholds (warning, error, critical- these
        thresholds are user configurable). This is all done using the snips
        library functions, so in effect, all the monitor needs to do is get the
        value for the variable being monitored and read the thresholds from a
        config file. The snips library ensures consistency in the way that the
        monitoring is processed by the rest of the system.</p>
        <p>Each monitor is unique in the way that it monitors its respective
        variable. The DNS monitor needs to make an authoritative DNS query to
        see if the dns server is configured properly, the Port monitor needs to
        connect to TCP or UDP ports to ensure that any processes are responding
        properly, and the SNMP monitor needs to monitor snmp variables using the
        SNMP protocol. The intelligence about the entity being monitored and how
        to monitor it lies strictly in the monitor- the rest of the snips
        subsystem&nbsp; is just expecting a&nbsp; device name, variable and its
        value.</p>
        <p>A fair amount of effort has gone into making the monitors very
        efficient where possible in order to allow them to scale to a large
        number of devices. Connectionless (UDP) monitors are specially well
        suited to using the select() system call so that many devices can be
        queried at the same time and the monitor then waits for the responses to
        come in. The other option was to fork multiple processes with a single
        parent and each process monitors one device. However, the level of
        scalability that could be achieved with the first method proved to be
        far more than what could be achieved with the forking method.</p>
        <p>To emphasize the above, consider 'pinging' 100 devices with 5 packets
        each, waiting 1 second for each response and 1 sec between each packet
        to the same host. If done serially, this would take at least 500 seconds
        for each pass. If we fork multiple processes to do it in parallel, this
        would take about 5 seconds, but we would have to fork 100 processes. The&nbsp;
        'multiping' monitor could send out 1 packet to each of the 100 devices
        in about 10 seconds and then listen for the responses to come in-
        effectively taking about 15 seconds for the entire pass.</p>
        <p>Building this level of 'multi-tasking' is a lot more difficult in the
        TCP based services since it would require non-blocking I/O, but it it
        important to do this for monitors such as 'portmon'. All of these type
        of monitors (using select()) are limited by the MAXFD value (maximum
        open file descriptors that can be handled by the select() call) which
        was 64 in older OS versions, and is 1024 in newer Operating systems.
        This implies that a monitor using non-blocking async sockets can monitor
        these many devices at a time using a single process.</p>
        <p>The 'hostmon'&nbsp; monitor is an example of letting the remote hosts
        (that are being monitored) do the local data collection (i.e.
        distributing the 'time consuming' part to hostmon-clients). The
        'hostmon' process runs on the snips monitoring host and simply takes all
        these data files and uses them as raw input for processing.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the monitors do not need any data other than what is
        in the snips data structure written to disk (the raw data), whereas in
        others they need to store ancillary variable and device specific
        information in memory. All possible efforts are made to avoid storing
        unnecessary data in memory and having 'bloated' monitoring processes.</p>
        <p>While developing new monitors, asynchronous socket polling should be
        used where possible, and they should store minimal information in
        process memory (such as hostname, etc.) to avoid memory bloat.</p>
        <hr noshade>
        <h2><a name="userInterfaces">User Interfaces</a></h2>
        <p>The user interfaces need to display the <u>current</u> state of&nbsp;
        the devices being monitored, and this 'current' data is stored on disk
        (in the 'data' directory). This allows any number of users and monitors
        to view the same consistent data, and run only one set of monitors
        (unlike some other systems which need a separate monitor for each
        display).</p>
        <p>The other diversion from traditional network monitoring packages is
        the displaying of monitored data using text lines and not a map or other
        graphical interface. The reason this approach was taken is that in
        practical experience, a network diagram was always done in some
        'drawing' tool and the map on the NMS was not updated regularly. Even
        today, most network/lan diagrams are maintained in a tool such as Visio,
        and the NMS graphical interface is always a 'second' copy. This and
        being able to view line based data from any terminal weighed very
        heavily in favor of a non-graphical user interface.</p>
        <h4>snipstv (Text based)</h4>
        <p><strong>snipstv</strong>&nbsp; (snips Text-View) is a simple Unix
        'curses' based TTY interface. It reads the raw data from disk and
        formats it for displaying on the screen. It has limited intelligence,
        and its method of setting an alarm is when it sees a change in the
        number of 'down' items.</p>
        <h4>snipsweb (Web)</h4>
        <p>Originally contributed by a user and now part of the core
        distribution, this is a Web based frontend to the datafiles. It allows
        running CGI's and troubleshooting listed events and all the other
        benefits of a web interface.</p>
        <p><img src="images/snipsweb.gif" alt="snipsweb.gif" width="609" height="692"></p>
        <p>This web interface automatically refreshes periodically, plays an
        audio clip if a device changes its severity level, etc. A 'status'
        message can be displayed next to each event which is inserted by any
        valid operator. Users are assigned access levels which controls how much
        information they can view or edit.</p>
        <h4>tkSnips (Tcl/Tcl)</h4>
        <p>This is a client-server application contributed by Lydia Leong. The
        tkSnips client connects to the <em>ndaemon</em> process on the host
        system, and displays the snips data in a window. This client can run on
        any OS that can support Tcl/Tk (PC, Mac, Unix environments).</p>
        <p><img src="images/tkSnips.gif" alt="tkSnips.gif" width="533" height="532"></p>
        <p>This interface needs 'tixwish' on the system. Any number of clients
        can&nbsp; connect to the simple process (<em>ndaemon</em>) running on
        the snips host which sends data to all the clients periodically. <font color="#FF0000"><em>Currently
        there is no access control configured on the ndaemon process</em></font>,
        so this should be protected by a firewall, but this interface can be
        extended to add these features in the daemon if needed.</p>
        <hr noshade>
        <h2><a name="reporting">Reporting</a></h2>
        <p>The monitors in SNIPS generate an event (logged to the <em>snipslogd</em>
        logging daemon) only when the severity of a variable <u>changes</u>
        (i.e. it goes from <em>warning</em> to <em>error</em> or from <em>critical</em>
        back to <em>info</em>. The thresholds for the various severities are
        defined by the user, and this tends to reduce the irrelevant data points
        from the collected data. This threshold triggered event generation&nbsp;
        allows a monitor to poll a device or variable as frequently as it likes
        (30 secs, 10 minutes), but it will generate a logging entry only if the
        variable crosses one of the thresholds.</p>
        <p>This approach of recording values only when the state changes also
        reduces the quantity of historical data significantly. Even though some
        granularity is lost, statistical analysis can easily be done on the
        collected data by using the time interval that a variable remained in a
        particular level.</p>
        <p>'snipslogd' is similar to the Unix 'syslog' process- it allows piping
        the log message to an external program or writing to a file&nbsp; based
        on the monitor name. This forms the basis of&nbsp; invoking SMS scripts
        to do paging, sending email, automated insertion into trouble ticketing
        systems, auto problem analysis, etc.- the possibilities are virtually
        unlimited.</p>
        <p>Currently this system writes to flat files, but the data can easily
        be piped to a process that writes into a database. Note that the
        'current' data that the monitors write to disk (the raw data which is
        displayed by the user interfaces) is overwritten in every pass by the
        monitor. Hence the size of those files is fixed and does not grow over
        time.</p>
        <hr noshade>
        <h2><a name="futureWork">Future Work</a></h2>
        <p>The package does not interface to any database, there are some
        benefits to storing the raw (monitored) and <em>snipslogd</em>
        historical information in a database such as MySQL, etc. The main
        advantage is that this would allow retrieving all events for a device or
        address using an sql query.</p>
        <p>The monitors should automatically fork into multiple processes if
        their config file is very large and takes too long to do a single pass.
        Currently this is a manual process using the '-x' flag or creating
        symlinks to the monitors with different names.</p>
        <p>A Java based user interface along the same lines as tkSnips would
        allow running the display on any platform and one could build a lot of
        graphing, reporting functionality into the gui itself.</p>
        <p>Adding dependencies between variables and even devices and supress
        alarms based on this information would be very useful.</p>
        <p>In order to make this scalable, it would be useful to allow SNIPS
        running on different hosts to interact with each other. This is easily
        doable using the <em>snipslogd</em> daemon, since snipslogd can be
        enhanced to send an event to remote snipslogd's at other devices. The
        data can be isolated and&nbsp; referred to using the 'nodename' (or
        devicename) to prefix the data/events.</p>
