Subject: NOCOL enhancements

Status: RO

Over the years of dealing with a NOCOL installation that would have dozens
upon dozens of simultaneous users logged into the monitoring machine
running netconsole, it became abundantly clear that this was a vast
waste of resources on that machine, as well as an undesirable security
issue. Also, the limitations of the curses-based interface meant that
it was fairly difficult to highlight important items, etc.

I wrote ndaemon, which is a daemonized version of netconsole that scans
files in a similar way, but spits data over the network to the monitoring
clients that it multiplexes. The monitoring clients can be written in
anything; I chose Tcl/Tk, as a readily portable quick implementation.

I have attached both the source for ndaemon, and the Tcl/Tk client.
The client also requires TIX, which is a Tcl/Tk extension. It runs
on Unix, Windows, and the Mac.
