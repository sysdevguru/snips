		[-l <level 1:4>] [alternate data directory]

	d		- Debug mode (toggle)

The User Screen:
---------------
The screen is divided into two sections- the EVENT section and the MESSAGES
section. All device events are displayed in the EVENT section and any text
messages are displayed in the MESSAGES section. These messages are displayed
in rotation and scroll in each screenful.

By default the screen is updated every 15 seconds. However, by using
the 'freeze' option, the screen is updated only when the user hits
a key.

The size of the 'event' window can be manipulated using the 'c' (contract)
and the 'x' (eXpand) keys. The message window grows correspondingly larger
as the event window shrinks in size.

Output Display Filter
---------------------
The output for the events can be filtered and only events matching a string
be displayed on the screen. The syntax of the search pattern is:

	word1 & word2 | word3

so that only the events that have 'word1' and 'word2' (both together) OR
word3 will be displayed. Regular expressions are not supported. All words
are converted to lowercase for case insensetive matching.

The filter is only applied to the 'visible' text, i.e. if currently the
devices  'address' field is not displayed, then the filter will not applied
to the address field.

Rating
------
The rating indicates the status of the device for the previous 4 (or 8) polls.
The most recent poll is on the left. The bit field is set to '1' for status
UP and '0' for status down when polled.

Terminal Type
-------------
If your terminal type is unsuitable, you are prompted for the type
when you start the program. Common terminal types are:

	vt100, vtxxx			DEC terminals
	vt100-w, vt200-w		DEC terminals in 132 col mode
	xterm				for X window terminal emulator
	xterm-color			for color NCURSES support
