			DEV NOTES for PINGMON

1. ippingmon- If too many devices on the command line, then the environment
   variable cuts off the cmd line (limited by sysconf(SC_ARG_MAX)??). So
   should fork and use pipes to write the list of devices on the stdin.

2. does not use 'read_event()' and 'rewrite_event()' but uses read()
   and write() directly for speed.
