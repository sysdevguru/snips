# Config file for 'tpmon' - throughput monitor
#
# The program connects to the discard port (port 9) of the listed machines
# and transfers data for 30 seconds to measure the thruput. It then sleeps
# for POLLINTERVAL seconds.
# Sleep for 2 hours between polls

POLLINTERVAL	7200

# To enable RRDtool data collection
RRDTOOL  ON

# If the thruput (in bits per second) falls below the threshold, it raises
# the severity to WARNING level. you can use the 'tptest' program to see
# the typical thruput to a device.
