WHAT IS IT?
-----------
Hostmond is a Perl script that periodically collects infomation about a host
and dumps it to a file that can be collected by a variety of means by a
monitoring system.
Lines of the output file (/tmp/<hostname>.hostmon) look like:
  <Interface> <value> <units> <Sub-interface>
  DFspace_avail 308 MB /usr


FILES
-----

Hostmon.pm
  Module for our monitoring system that grabs hostmond data in parallel
  (using udp) from all monitor hosts.  Not usable out of the box, but a
  useful example.
hostmond
  Our replacement for "hostmon-client".  All it does is create the datafile
  (/tmp/<hostname>.hostmon).  This is Linux specific.  If you want the
  modularity of the Nocol hostmon-client then you are probably better off
  changing the Nocol version to act like hostmond.
services
  Neccessary services entries to make (x)inetd examples work.
inetd.conf
  Example for inetd setup
xinetd.conf
  Example for xinetd setup
udpcat
  Expects to be called from (x)inetd.  Dumps file specified on command line
  to UDP socket attached to STDIN.
udpcli
  Connects to a remote host on specified port, sends "GIMME IT!!" and
  displays whatever it gets back.  If the included (x)inetd setups are used
  in conjunction with hostmond this will produce the contents of
  /tmp/<hostname>.hostmon.
