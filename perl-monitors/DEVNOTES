		     DEV NOTES FOR perl-monitors


1. Some monitors are rewriting the entire datafile each time, and need
   to 'forget' devices, so they cannot call the generic snips_main().

2. Enhance SNMPgeneric to multi-task. Merge snmpmon with this.

3. snmpmon-collector and hostmon-collector dont use the name+IP for the
   monitored devices (like in other monitors). The 'comment' field in
   the monitored data is stored in the 'host.name' field of the events.
   (this comment is usually the disk partition, or interface number).

4. snmpmon and hostmon are not inserting the TIMESTAMP from the data
   files into the event structure, so the timestamp in the event
   structure is a little skewed.

5. Because snmpmon and hostmon create event entries during the first
   poll (from existing data and not from all the configuration data),
   a HUP signal does not work as expected since there are no events to
   copy on rereading the cnfig file.

6. snmpwalk and snmpget have huge overheads since they have to load the
   mib file with each invocation. Modify to read parameters from stdin
   and run in a loop.
