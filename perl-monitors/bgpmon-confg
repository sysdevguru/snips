# bgpmon-confg - bgpmon master configuration
#
## Use this file with bgpmon v2.0 and above.
#
###
#  - You define router types (objects).
#  - Then, for each of your router, specify its type and login password.
#  - Finally, define which routers you want to monitor and optionally, the
#    peers and max severity based on the AS number.
###
#
# Set a different polling interval - default 5 mins
pollinterval 300

## THIS SECTION DOES NOT REQUIRE EDITING NORMALLY
# OBJECT DEFINITIONS - how to obtain and parse the bgp summary
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: the version numbers linked with each object are the
#                 versions of firmware that the configuration was
#                 tested with.  It could very well work with other (especially
#                 newer) versions of the firmware, and possibly older versions
#                 as well.  YOU DO NOT NEED TO ADD A NEW CONFIGURATION FOR YOUR
#                 FIRMWARE REVISION UNLESS NONE OF THE EXISTING ONES WORK.

## ROUTER DEFINITIONS - used in conjunction with peer/router statements
#
#	    NAME	TYPE               IP ADDRESS     PASS      USER (opt)
router_def  sfo-rtr	ASCEND_GRF_1.3.8   205.215.xx.xx  password	
router_def  pdl-bay	BAY_1.27    	   205.215.xx.xx  password  netadmin
router_def  bos-gw	CISCO_11.x	   205.215.xx.xx  password

## ROUTERS TO MONITOR - will monitor all bgp peers/sessions on a router
#
#	NAME
router	sfo-rtr
router	pdl-bay

## SINGLE PEERS TO MONITOR - will monitor only this peer on a router
# NOTE: you can put a - for the peer name if you wish the name to be
#       determined by DNS.
#
#	ROUTER NAME	PEER NAME 	PEER IP
peer	bos-gw		-		198.32.xx.xx
peer	bos-gw		mae-east	198.32.xx.xx

## SEVERITY - defines severity levels based on AS number
severity  DEFAULT  E_ERROR
severity  4006     E_CRITICAL	# Netrail (very important)
severity  3491     E_WARNING	# CAIS (so used to seeing it in alarm)

## Assume all peers on a router are unchanged from their last known status in
# the event that a router cannot be reached.  If you wish to assume that all
# peers would be down in this event, use 'down' as an assumption
#		assume <unchanged | down>
ASSUME unchanged
