# The information in this article applies to:

# 
# SUMMARY
# 
# The NetBIOS naming convention allows for 16 characters in a NetBIOS name.
# Microsoft, however, limits NetBIOS names to 15 characters and uses the
# 16th character as a NetBIOS suffix.
# 
# MORE INFORMATION
# 
# All NetBIOS names are 16 characters in length. A NetBIOS suffix is the
# 16th character of the 16-character NetBIOS name. The NetBIOS suffix is
# used by Microsoft Networking software to identify functionality installed
# on the registered device.
# 
# The following table lists the NetBIOS suffixes that are used by Microsoft
# Windows NT. The suffixes are listed in hexadecimal format because many of
# them are unprintable otherwise.

# NetBIOS name types describe the functionality of the registration.
# 
# Unique (U): The name may have only one IP address assigned to it. On a
# network device multiple occurrences of a single name may appear to be
# registered. The suffix may be the only unique character in the name.
# 
# Group (G): A normal group; the single name may exist with many IP
# addresses. WINS responds to a name query on a group name with the limited
# broadcast address (255.255.255.255). Because routers block the
# transmission of these addresses, the Internet Group was designed to
# service communications between subnets.
# 
# Multihomed (M): The name is unique, but due to multiple network interfaces
# on the same computer this configuration is necessary to permit the
# registration. The maximum number of addresses is 25.
# 
# Internet Group (I): This is a special configuration of the group name used
# to manage Windows NT Domain names.
# 
# Domain Name (D): New in Windows NT 4.0.
