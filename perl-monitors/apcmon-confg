## Config file for APC Smart UPS's
#
# The config file uses absolute values or deltas.  It uses an absolute
# value in the style of the hostmon config file if a '-' is placed in the
# nominal value field.  Otherwise the thresholds represent differences from
# the nominal value.  This is useful in saying that, say, a difference
# of more than 10 volts is a problem - rather than saying that only low or
# only high values are bad.
# 
# Also, to enable the UPS to get shut down, there's a hook to ask the monitor
# to cause it to turn itself off.  One puts a file in the snips etc directory
# with the config file, which is named apc_shutdown.  If this file exists
# apcmon will ask the UPS to shut down.  One should, of course, have
# set the UPS grace period to a large enough value so that the monitor
# can run and send the sequence before you feel compelled to halt the system.
# 
# E.g. the shutdown grace period is three minutes, so you create the file,
# wait however long it takes for the apcmon to run again (sleepint) , then
# perhaps wait a bit more, then start the halt.  If apcmon only runs at five
# minute intervals this is not going to work all the time, but if the grace
# period is greater than the sleepint (by however long it takes the halt to
# complete) you can ensure that things will work.
