## Config file for SQLmon snips monitor
#
# Format:
#  POLLINTERVAL  600   (only the last one takes effect)
#  <name> <addr>  <maxseverity> <DBI driver> <username> <password> <SQL query>
#
# The first two fields are the standard devicename and deviceaddr that snips
# wants. The third is the maximum severity that the device will rise to. The
# third is the dbi driver string. The above works for mysql; others may be
# different. Note that you have to include the hostname here--the script
# doesn't try to pull it from field 1 or 2. Next two are the username and
# password to access the database. Everything from there on is the sql query
# to execute. If the query is successful it uses the return value in the
# "value" field. If not it sets that to 0 and bumps the severity. The above
# query--in case you're not dbi proficient--is selecting everything in the
# user table of the mysql database.
