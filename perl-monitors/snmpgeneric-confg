# If OID starts with a plus, then we will walk that OID and add up values that
# are returned from the COMP evalution.
#
# COMP must not have any spaces in it.  Otherwise it is a standard PERL
# expression the result of which is added to the total to compare against
# the threshold.  The character '*' is replaced with the current value coming
# off the tree we are walking.
