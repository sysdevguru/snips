			      SNIPS Known BUGS
			      -----------------

hostmon
-------
 - error in parsing client data causes variables to show up as Critical
   (especially DFspace). Probably due to errors in regexp pattern.
   Should be fixed in v1.2

genweb.cgi
----------
When using nsmon, the Device name of dns servers in the web report are
all in the format:   "domain name"+"dns server name"

	e.g. "pacific.net.sg+ns5"

And it seems your genweb.cgi reads & compares the 'updates' file in the
fashion of "dns server name" only. Such that all the records in updates
are not matched. Here is a typical line from 'updates'

  pacific.net.sg+ns5:203.120.92.139:named-status  dont care -nocol01

(jonathantse@pacific.net.sg)

genweb.cgi
----------
i get the SNIPS webpage as expected if i click on the WARNING button
then click on the ERROR button the url slowly gets bigger:
 
http://snips.graphon.com/cgi-bin/genweb.cgi?view=Error&view=Warning&view=Warning
+&view=Warning&view=Warning
 
eventually it can be several hundred characters long. i just wanted
to know if this is expected behavior or if i have something
configured incorrectly.

eventually it can be several hundred characters long. i just wanted
to know if this is expected behavior or if i have something
configured incorrectly.

as far as the web interface is concerned:

/home/snips/public_html <-- main html/gifs
/home/snips/cgi_bin <-- cgi

I have ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/snips/cgi-bin/
for the virtualhost in apache's config.

it seems to be working, eventually i get this error from apache:
Request-URI Too Large

The requested URL's length exceeds the capacity limit for this server.

request failed: URI too long

and for some reason the URL is totally blacked out in the netscape
location bar(netscape 4.76/linux). never seen it do that, its just
a black bar accross the url itself. really weird :) so i guess
something must not be configured right.

any hints as to what i may of missed? thanks!

I have upgraded from NOCOL v4.2.2 to SNIPS v1.1. 

The problem I have is that my snmpgeneric output is saying NOTSET for the
variable/value. I have set this up in my snmpgeneric-confg file as below.

PWR_SUPPLY1 SW1-CORE-HBX-B .1.3.6.1.4.1.1991.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1 PowerStatus
public 3 3 3

Then the output is:

373 W PWR_SUPPLY1 SW1-CORE-HBX-B NOTSET= 2 10/01 16:20 snmpgeneric 

Can anyone help me in getting the variable to show on the NOCOL output web
page?

thanks

Hi,
I have any problems with snmpgeneric and snmpmon with snips1.1!
The script don't recognize the variable (NOTSET in the web browser) and =
the
result has always stayed at z=E9ro
I want to monitor the router CPU withe the MIB file =
"CISCO-PROCESS-MIB".
then, the snmpgeneric-confg is:
CPU-RO	192.168.16.248	.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.3.1	CPUTotal5sec
public		25	50	75
Is there an error?
therefore the rcisco script don't running.
Please, give me a solution.
Christophe Bouffard

I think I've reported this a couple of times in the past, but the
hostmon-client is still b0rken for clients that don't use NFS and have
gone so far as to disable its use... it likes to complain every poll
interval:

  nfsstat: kernel is not configured with the client nfs and rpc code.

Personally, I'd like to not have to remember which hosts this is
configured for and which it isn't... likewise, if it's not there, the
client should remember it and then not complain every few minutes (ie.
once is more than enough).

Another issue... hostmon-client does not seem to properly check for the
presence of snipsperl.conf like the other Perl monitors nicely do... ok,
it checks, but perhaps it should check its own directory first (and then
use it if it's there) and maybe let the "global" one (normally found in
/usr/local/snips or the like) override it or supplement it.  Yes, I
realize that this sort of "feature" is probably largely debately on the
pros and cons of doing that this way, particularly because I tend to
distribute my hostmons by simply tar'ing up the directories and moving
them over (probably should move a keepalive over as well or something).

Ok, I'll quiet down like a good little user, now, before I get majorly
LART'd... HeHe

Hi,

I am running trapmon and it works quite good.

But I have the following problems:

1. The receiced traps do not expire at all.

2. If I try to look at the trapmon-output file with snipstv or
   display_snips_datafile I get the following:

../data/trapmon-output: Data format version incompatible (is 0, not 1)

Any ideas out there?

Hi,

has anyone come across any config files limitations in radiusmon, i have
currently a number of hosts ( 7 to be exact) in my config file
(radiusmon-confg) , and the system cycles through them fine, and reports
they are all up and running correctly, however when i add another entry to
the config file and then reload radiusmon, i find the other hosts start
misbehaving and being marked as down, when they are in fact
not....removing
the new entry causes the hosts to all behave again....and even removing a
previously listed host and adding the new one works fine, it is just when
there are over 7 hosts it gets nasty...

the character count on just the host entries comes to 582 chars, and even
with all of the comments etc, comes to only 1505, and the longest line is
only 94 characters...

i am not sure if it is a character limit or what....anybody else had any
issue with the config files??

Cheers

I have a monitoring process that generates usage stats on DHCP lease pools.
I would like to have SNIPS detect and set a value.  I seem to be having 
problems in the set up of the detection.  The syslogmon process was 
restarted since reconfiguration, and I am still not seeing this in my
display.  What am I doing wrong, and can I set the variable=value from 
the monitor? As a secondary question, what are the limits on the address
length?

Looking for Address: 134.84.134.0 Variable=value:DhcpAvail=30
Alternate Address: ntc-xxx-Vlan775:134.84.134.0 Variable=value:DhcpAvail=30
I am running snips-1.2beta.  I have set $debug=3 in the script.  Ouput
from run/syslogmon.error is included below as well.

Hi,

We are upgrading our master monitoring server from an OLD OLD OLD
copy of Nocol to the latest Snips.... You'll be seeing ALOT from me...

We have a brand new machine set up, and its only logging a little
bit of stuff, however, we got this from syslogmon :

  Previous error file for syslogmon :

  syslogmon- Reading global config file /usr/local/etc/snips/etc/snips.conf
  (syslogmon).. locked pid-file, started new process (pid=12226)
  Out of memory!


Any ideas? We've never had Nocols syslogmon complain, and it
goes through 50-60Meg of logs a day.

		Thanks, Tuc/TTSG Internet Services, Inc.

Hi,

	Every time a machine goes over, we get :

WARNINGS
========
CHECK ERROR FILE /usr/local/etc/snips/run/etherload.error (new errors)


	Which is :

etherload: This is a SNIPS version
etherload- Reading global config file /usr/local/etc/snips/etc/snips.conf
(etherload).. locked pid-file, started new process (pid=12167)
Scan-interval= 15, sleeptime= 300

etherload: Thu Jan  3 16:50:47 2002 Bad bandwidth 117 >100

etherload: Thu Jan  3 17:06:42 2002 Bad bandwidth 114 >100


Does it NEED to print this.... I would think thats what snipslogd is
for..

For some reason, I've recently started getting these errors, over and
over and over again in my ~snips/run/hostmon-collector.error file.  I
can't see how this is getting a "null" host, however, looking at the
code (and, to the best of my knowledge/recollection, nothing's changed
in the config file recently, though I did move the machine(s) to a new
subnet a few weeks back)

-- begin
forked 1 processes

  [...]
hostmon-collector (child 1 of 279): Unknown host 
-- end

Hi,

	We just brought our system up, and are seeing alot of :

	I saw something in the archives about it, but no resolution. What
is this trying to tell me, and how do I stop it? Its happening QUITE 
frequently.

Hi,

Hostmon is saying there are disks that are over the limit, but
when snipslogd passes it to my scripts, all I see is :

Tue Jan 15 13:45:13 2002 [hostmon]: DEVICE +o.ttsg.com o.ttsg.com VAR DFspace_%used 88 95 %full LEVEL Warning LOGLEVEL Warning STATE down


But in genweb, it sees it properly...

Whats up? Scanned the archives quickly, no answers...
